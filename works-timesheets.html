                                        <p><strong> Product Context</strong>
                                            <br>Synnch is a SaaS application helping Australian businesses manage R&D tax incentive claims. Accurate timesheet data linked to specific R&D projects is crucial for compliance. Target users for this UI include staff performing R&D, project managers, and consultants overseeing claims.  
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <br><strong>Project Goal</strong> 
                                            <br>To design an intuitive and efficient user interface for staff members and managers to view, track, and manage R&D hours within the Synnch platform.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <br><strong>The Problem</strong>
                                            <br>Businesses claiming the R&D Tax Incentive face a critical disconnect: compliance requires timely, detailed timesheets, but workflow realities often push R&D documentation to the last minute. This results in:
    
                                            <br><strong>&#x2705; Inaccurate Data</strong> Hours were often guessed instead of accurately tracked, putting the R&D claim at risk.
                                            <br><strong>&#x2705; Reporting Issues</strong> Managers found it difficult to monitor and confirm R&D work across the team throughout the year.
                                            <br><strong>&#x2705; Financial Loss </strong> Using rough estimates and inconsistent staff rates led to smaller R&D claims than what could have been recovered.
                                            <br><strong>&#x2705; Poor Visibility</strong> Staff and managers lacked intuitive tools to easily log, view granular R&D effort (by day/week/month), or compare team contributions effectively, hindering both accuracy and timely completion.
                                        </p>

                                            <br> <strong> My Role & Responsibilities </strong> 
                                            <br>UI/UX Designer. Responsibilities included user flow mapping, wireframing, prototyping, visual design, interaction design for the timesheet viewing/entry interface. Collaborated with Product Owner, Developers
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <br><strong>Constraints & Timeline:</strong>
                                            <br><strong>1. Existing Platform Integration: </strong> We joined the project after core Synnch modules were already developed:
                                    
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Projects Module: Contained detailed R&D activity descriptions.</li>
                                            <li>Expenditure Module: Integrated with Xero to pull financial data, including staff wage information essential for timesheet value calculation. The new Timesheets UI had to seamlessly integrate with this existing architecture, ensuring data compatibility and technical feasibility (e.g., accurately linking R&D hours to specific projects and staff data from the Expenditure module).</li> 
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
                                    
                                        <p>
                                            <br><strong>2. Design System Adherence </strong> The Synnch owners provided an existing UI kit and style guide. All new designs were required to strictly adhere to this established visual language and component library to ensure platform consistency.

                                                    <li>&#x2705; Present a clear, traceable log of R&amp;D hours and project involvement</li>
                                                    <li>&#x2705; Be intuitive for both the claimant and auditor to navigate without training</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>Designing with auditability in mind added constraints but helped sharpen the product’s value.</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p><strong>IV. Iteration and UI Decisions</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                                        <p>In a traditional calendar view (daily, weekly, monthly), not all details can fit on the screen, especially when multiple staff members are selected.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                                        <p>To address this, I explored alternatives and landed on the side panel pattern:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A persistent side panel provides context without obscuring the main view</li>
                                            <li>It allows users to click through records while still seeing what’s underneath</li>
                                            <li>Compared to modals, it avoids breaking flow and reduces navigation friction</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>This component became essential for displaying detailed logs, comments, or evidence attachments linked to a selected time entry.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="images/work/timesheets/Side Panel Dark.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
                                            <small> The side panel lets users view and edit details while keeping the main table visible—making multitasking smooth and uninterrupted.</small>
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>V. Design Execution</h4>
                                        <p>Translating the insights into a user-centered solution involved designing an intuitive interface for viewing, adding, and managing R&amp;D hours, while adhering to the existing platform's constraints and style.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Multiple Views (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Table, Detailed):</strong></p>
                                        <p>Users can seamlessly switch between daily, weekly, monthly, table view, and a detailed side panel view using clear tabs or buttons. This caters to different user needs – from quick daily checks to weekly summaries and in-depth data scanning.</p>
                                        <div class="work-images grid">

                                            <p><small> Multiple timesheet views—daily, weekly, monthly, and table view —to support different user needs and levels of reporting detail.</small></p>
                                        </div>

                                        <p><strong>Consistent Interface &amp; Design System Adherence:</strong></p>
                                        <p>Leveraging Synnch's established design system and UI kit was foundational. This ensured visual consistency with the rest of the platform, provided familiarity for existing users, streamlined development, and reinforced the brand identity.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Flexible Viewing &amp; Navigation:</strong></p>
                                        <p>Recognizing the need for different levels of analysis and user roles, the design incorporated intuitive navigation elements:</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#x2705; Financial Year &amp; Date Controls:</strong></p>
                                        <p>Clear controls allow users to easily navigate to specific time periods relevant to R&amp;D claims.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#x2705; Staff Selection:</strong></p>
                                        <p>A straightforward selector enables switching between viewing an individual staff member's detailed hours or comparing multiple staff members side-by-side, catering to different review needs.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#x2705; Handling Complexity (Multi-Staff View):</strong></p>
                                        <p>While designing the multi-staff comparison, we prioritized clarity and performance. Displaying a full monthly calendar view for multiple staff simultaneously presented significant UI clutter and potential performance challenges. Therefore, the multi-staff comparison effectively focuses on daily and weekly granularities, addressing the primary comparison needs identified in research.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Core Functionality &amp; Data Management:</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Adding R&amp;D Hours:</strong></p>
                                        <p>A prominent and easily accessible 'Add R&amp;D Hours' action allows staff members to quickly log their time, link it to the relevant R&amp;D project/activity, and differentiate R&amp;D vs. non-R&amp;D hours, directly addressing their primary task.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="images/work/timesheets/Add Entry.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
                                            <small> Clicking 'Add R&D Hours' reveals dropdowns and input fields for hours, descriptions, and evidence—keeping everything in one place for fast, accurate entry.</small>
                                        </p>
                                        <p><strong>Information Accessibility (Side Panel):</strong></p>
                                        <p>To keep the main timesheet views clean and scannable, detailed information (like full activity descriptions, evidence links, or notes) is accessible via a contextual side panel. This panel appears upon selecting a specific time entry, providing comprehensive details and also serving as the location for editing existing entries without losing context.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Data Portability (CSV Export):</strong></p>
                                        <p>An 'Export to CSV' function is included in relevant views, allowing users to easily extract timesheet data for offline analysis, reporting, or specific auditing requirements.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Micro Interactions and Feedback</strong></p>
                                        <p>Subtle visual feedback upon successful time entry provides immediate confirmation to the user. Furthermore, inline validation within the 'Add Hours' form proactively guides users to not enter hours beyond their daily working hours.</p>

                                        <!-- <p><strong>Prototyping for Validation:</strong></p>
                                        <p>An interactive prototype (e.g., built in Figma) simulating the key user flows – navigating views, adding hours, using the side panel – was created. This proved invaluable for stakeholder demonstrations, gathering early feedback on usability and interactions, and providing clear specifications for the development team ahead of the build phase.</p>
                                        <p>The interactive prototype was crucial not only for stakeholder alignment but also for early validation of the core workflows, particularly testing the ease of linking hours to projects and the intuitiveness of the side-panel interaction model before committing development resources. (Addresses: Interactive prototype created)</p> -->
                                        

                                        <h4>VI. Validation and Iteration</h4>
                                        <p>During the development handoff, the dev team raised an important need that wasn’t part of the original scope: the ability to set individual working parameters for each staff member. This included things like full-time vs. part-time status, standard daily or weekly hour limits, and overtime handling—key details needed to ensure accurate R&amp;D compliance.</p>
                                        <p>To address this quickly, I designed a new Staff Settings page. Using the existing Synnch design system, I created a clean and consistent interface with standard fields and checkboxes. This addition was implemented smoothly and helped improve timesheet accuracy and flexibility, without affecting the overall development timeline.</p>

                                        <p>This project offered valuable lessons in designing for a growing SaaS platform with real-world complexity:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Designing for Consistency Across a Live Platform</strong></p>
                                                <p>Working within the existing Synnch platform taught me the importance of maintaining visual and functional consistency. Using the established design system wasn't just about staying on-brand—it streamlined development and ensured a smooth, unified experience across modules.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Adapting to Evolving Requirements</strong></p>
                                                <p>Like many SaaS projects, the scope changed as we uncovered new needs. Features like the multi-staff view and the Staff Settings page emerged mid-way. I learned to stay flexible, collaborate closely with Product and Dev teams, and iterate quickly without losing sight of the core user experience.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration Drives Better Design</strong></p>
                                                <p>The idea for the Staff Settings page came directly from discussions with developers. It reminded me how technical feedback can surface hidden UX requirements. Staying connected with all disciplines—tech, product, and stakeholders—helped shape more complete and user-focused solutions.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Anticipating Hidden Complexity</strong></p>
                                                <p>At first, timesheet entry seemed straightforward. But as we dug deeper, we realized R&amp;D calculations required dynamic handling of staff roles (full-time, part-time, overtime). Building flexibility into the design early helped us future-proof the experience as those needs became clearer.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Balancing Multiple Design Tracks</strong></p>
                                                <p>Throughout the project, I balanced designing new features, reviewing previous work, and planning for future iterations. This taught me to prioritize effectively while still maintaining consistency and clarity across the product.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p><strong>Designing Without Full Validation (Handled Carefully)</strong></p>
                                                <p>In some cases, we had to move ahead before getting direct user feedback—especially when timelines were tight. I leaned on stakeholder insights, UX best practices, and clear documentation to reduce risks and stay user-centric even when iteration came fast.</p>
